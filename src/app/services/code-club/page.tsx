            <p>
              At Code Club, we aim to cultivate children&apos;s love and
              curiosity for coding. Our clubs offer a fun and engaging
              environment for children to learn programming skills, develop
              problem-solving abilities, and unleash their creativity through
              coding projects. We believe that coding is an essential skill for
              the future, and we&apos;re here to make learning fun!

              What happens at a club?
            </h3>
            <p>
              At our Code Club sessions, young coders embark on exciting
              projects using the Scratch programming language, created by MIT.
              They learn to create their own interactive stories, games, and
              animations while developing computational thinking skills. Our
              sessions are guided by experienced mentors who provide support and
              encouragement, fostering a collaborative and fun learning
              environment.

            <p>
              Coding, also known as computer programming, is the process of
              creating instructions that tell a computer what to do. It&apos;s
              like writing a recipe, but instead of cooking, you&apos;re telling
              a computer how to perform tasks or solve problems. Learning to
              code helps develop logical thinking, creativity, and
              problem-solving skills - abilities that are valuable in many
              aspects of life and future careers.
